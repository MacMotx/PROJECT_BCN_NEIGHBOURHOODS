## Final project for the Data Science course at the IT Academy Barcelona


The purpose of this study is to show if the use of Machine Learning Clusterization Algorithms (KMeans) for each of the five
years being studied in pairs could deliver potential insights about the systemic differences amongst Barcelona’s neighbourhoods
using a lighter and compact dataset of a few selected features.

🎯 Our goal would be to repeatedly obtain clear and traceable distinct neighbourhood groups based
on the socioeconomic factors present in the used data-set.

🏅 Ideally, revealed trends would have to resemble the existing reality in terms of neighbourhood
changes, and should those changes be assessed by public-domain knowledge.


💾 We used public data from the City-Council Statistics dpt. to create the used data-set with the
intention of representing yearly series of all the Barcelona city’s neighbourhoods including variables
historically related to displacement and neighbourhood change phenomena. 
The studied DataSet can be conceptually divided in three categories:

1. Housing Factors: Here we include terms relative to the rent market as well as the real state
market. From average prices to amount of registered purchases and a rent growth rate, calculated subtracting expired contracts from newly signed contracts. Also the area of each
neighbourhood classified per registered activity, that provides a clearer sense of the "Urban-Scheme" for each of the studied neighbourhoods.

2. Resident Characteristics: Where we include percentages of population by certain conditions
like higher education, foreigners and unemployed.

3. Economic Info: Here we include terms relative to wealth (i.e. disposable income) and it’s
inequality distribution (i.e. Gini index)


📙 Each Jupyter Notebook contains one phase of the study, namely; 
- Data collecting
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Techniques  


💼 Final document in paper format is attached as a pdf named "Barcelona_Clustering-2"


## 🛑 BEFORE YOU START!! 🖐

If you're interested in the EDA Notebook...due either to the number & nature of the features in the dataset and the context delivered in the comentaries or to the animated graphics (like 3D clusterings and maps) I included, It happens to be considered "not very small". So the Github🐿 will appear telling you the file is too heavy to be displayed on this site.

🤫Rumour has it that if you press the download button then you're  able to visualize it as easily as any Jupyter Notebook.🧐


Enjoy! 🤸‍♂️


## 🧏‍♂️ SINCE YOU'RE HERE...

As a very Memeable professional NBA coach once said

So...any kind of Feedback will always be much welcome & appreciated, specially the bad one, you know...
