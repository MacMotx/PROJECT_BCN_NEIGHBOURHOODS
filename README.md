# PROJECT_BCN_NEIGHBOURHOODS

### Final project for the Data Science course


The purpose of this study is to show if systemic differences amongst Barcelona’s neighbourhoods
could be grouped using a machine learning clusterization algorithm (KMeans) for each of the five
years being studied in pairs.

🎯 Our goal would be to repeatedly obtain clear and traceable distinct neighbourhood groups based
on the socioeconomic factors present in the used data-set.

🏅Ideally, revealed trends would have to resemble the existing reality in terms of neighbourhood
changes, and should those changes be assessed by public-domain knowledge.

We used public data from the City-Council Statistics dpt. to create the used data-set with the
intention of representing yearly series of all the Barcelona city’s neighbourhoods including variables
historically related to displacement and neighbourhood change phenomena.

Data is conceptually divided in three categories:

1. 🏘 Housing Factors: Here we include terms relative to the rent market as well as the real state
market. From average prices to amount of registered purchases and a rent growth rate, cal-
culated subtracting expired contracts from newly signed contracts. Also the area of each
neighbourhood classified per registered activity, that provides a clearer sense of the studied
neighbourhoods.
2. 🧍‍♂️ Resident Characteristics: Where we include percentages of population by certain conditions
like higher education, foreigners and unemployed.
3. 📈 Economic Info: Here we include terms relative to wealth (i.e. disposable income) and it’s
inequality distribution (i.e. Gini index
